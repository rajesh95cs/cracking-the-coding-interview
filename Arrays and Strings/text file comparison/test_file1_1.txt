A Waterloo Medal was designed by sculptor Benedetto Pistrucci. Commemorating the
Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), the medal was commissioned by the British
Government in 1819 on the instructions of George IV while Prince Regent;
copies were to be presented to the victorious generals and to leaders of
Britain's allies. The Prince Regent and William Wellesley-Pole, Master of the
Mint, had been impressed by Pistrucci's models, and gave him the commission.
Pistrucci fell from grace at the Royal Mint in 1823 by insisting on his own
designs and refusing to copy another designer's work, and he likely concluded
he would be sacked when the medal was finished. He delayed completion until
1849, when he submitted the matrices to the Mint. As most of the intended
recipients had died by then, and relations with France had improved, the medals
were never struck, though modern-day editions have been made for sale to
collectors. Pistrucci's designs have been greatly praised by numismatic writers.
